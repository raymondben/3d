# Bedmap2

3D print of the bedrock and overlying ice sheet of Antarctica

Data from [BEDMAP2](http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//bas_research/our_research/az/bedmap2/).

The ice sheet STL file is oriented upside-down: print with support material. The top side of the ice sheet (i.e. the lower side when oriented upside down) is relatively smooth and will print reasonably well with support. The underside of the ice sheet (upper side when oriented upside down) is more detailed.
